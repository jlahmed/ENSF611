    "1. There were no missing values. If there were, I would delete the row because there would be no way for me to find the missing info. There is only one entry per animal so I cannot fill with most frequent as it would likely be incorrect. I cannot fill with zero either since all the features are applicable. I could alternatively consider dropping the column if the missing values are all in one column and that column has similar values for all. This would indicate that this feature is not that important for classification.\n",
    "2. I have a mixture of numerical and categorical values. The animal column is just an ID column where each entry is unique and can be dropped since it does not help in predicting in which group the animal belongs. The legs feature has distinct values and as such should be treated as categorical data. Since there is no order to it, I use one-hot encoding. The rest of columns in the feature matrix are 0 and 1s representing boolean value and are already suited for machine learning. They don't require scaling or encoding."

    "1. I need classification because I am dealing with distinct values. Each entry will belong to groups 1,2,3,4,5,6, or 7.\n",
    "2. I chose to go with the Random Forest model since it gave me the best validation score at 0.96 which is close to the training score of 0.97. It is a good model as it has high training/validation scores with low variance. The logistic regression and SVC show signs of overfit as the training score is ~1 while also having lower validation scores than the Random Forest (higher variance). I ensured that the selected hyperparameters are in the middle of the selected range. This shows that I selected a good range for the parameter grid.\n",
    "3. As discussed above, the random forest worked best. Given that my dataset has mostly boolean values, Random Forest might capture non-linear relationships effectively while Logistic Regression assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target. Also my dataset is quite small so it is possible that outliers carried a lot of weight. The SVC and LogisticRegression would be more affected by this than Random Forest as discussed in class.\n"

    "1. I used the default score method which computes the accuracy for classification.\n",

    "3. Although the model did good with a test score of 0.95, I would like to have more data to train/test before using in real world. This dataset was only 100 entries with single entry for each animal. How we split the data can affect the results with this small dataset as some groups have very small number of samples. This imbalance might affect the model's ability to learn patterns accurately for those small groups. Also, we know that animals have lots of variation so we should use more data to train the model on those variations. This will create a more robust model."
